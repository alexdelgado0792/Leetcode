# 4.- [Median of Two Sorted Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/)

There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.

Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.

>Example 1:<br/>
nums1 = [1, 3]<br/>
nums2 = [2]<br/>
The median is 2.0

>Example 2:<br/>
nums1 = [1, 2]<br/>
nums2 = [3, 4]<br/>
The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
